  # ‚ú® CustomLinkedList
  Darkuz_69 here!! This is my take on linked list, the first of my custom libraries project.
  This is in preparation for my DSA subject.

  #  ü§ñ Methods
  This linked-list implementation is written in C++. I used OOP for this one. Here are some of its methods:
  - ü´∏push_front(data) -> pushes/inserts a node at the start of the list
  - ü´∏push_back(data) -> pushes/inserts a node at the end of the list
  - ü´∏push_at_nth(index, data) -> pushes/inserts a node at the nth position
  - üóëÔ∏èremove_front() -> removes the node at the start of the list
  - üóëÔ∏èremove_back() -> removes the node at the end of the list
  - üóëÔ∏èremove_nth(index) -> removes the node at the nth position
  - üööget_length() -> returns the size of the list
  - üñ®Ô∏èprint_list() -> prints the contents of the list in forward manner
  - üñ®Ô∏èprint_list_reversed() -> prints the contents of the list in reversed manner

There are also exception classes for error handling:
 - ‚ö†Ô∏è LinkedListisEmptyException
 - ‚ö†Ô∏è LinkedListIndexOutofRangeException
 - ‚ö†Ô∏è LinkedListMemoryAllocationException
 - ‚ö†Ô∏è LinkedListMaximumLimitException

These file contains the "behind-the-scenes" process as I create this project. Some phrases are written in my native language, so apologies in advance (if someone finds this repo)
