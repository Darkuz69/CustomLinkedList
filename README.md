  # ✨ CustomLinkedList
  Darkuz_69 here!! This is my take on linked list, the first of my custom libraries project.
  This is in preparation for my DSA subject.

  #  🤖 Methods
  This linked-list implementation is written in C++. I used "classes" for this one. Here are some of its methods:
  - 🫸 offer(data) -> pushes/inserts a node at the start of the list
  - 🫸 push(data) -> pushes/inserts a node at the end of the list
  - 🫸 insert(index, data) -> pushes/inserts a node at the nth position
  - 🗑️ poll() -> removes the node at the start of the list
  - 🗑️ pop() -> removes the node at the end of the list
  - 🗑️ remove(data) -> removes the node with the same data
  - 👀 peekFirst() -> returns a read-only version of the data of the head node
  - 👀 peekLast() -> returns a read-only version of the data of the last node
  - 👀 peekAt(index) -> returns a read-only version of the data of the nth node 
  - 🖨️ printList() -> prints the contents of the list in forward manner
  - 🖨️ printListReversed() -> prints the contents of the list in reversed manner
  - 🚚 getSize() -> returns the current size of the list (read-only)
  - 📪 isEmpty() -> returns true if the list is empty
  - 👉 indexOf(data) -> returns the index of the data given

  📢 Note: This implementation uses 0-based indexing...

There are also exception classes for error handling:
 - ⚠️ LinkedListisEmptyException
 - ⚠️ LinkedListIndexOutofRangeException
 - ⚠️ LinkedListMemoryAllocationException
 - ⚠️ LinkedListMaximumLimitException

These file contains the "behind-the-scenes" process as I create this project. Some phrases are written in my native language, so apologies in advance (if someone finds this repo)
