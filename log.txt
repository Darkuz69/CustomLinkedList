    This is my take on linked list. 
    This implementation of mine uses generic typing, 
    which means, the linked list can store any type of data
    based on the type given.
    Example:
        LinkedList<int> -> LinkedList of integers
        LinkedList<char *> -> LinkedList of strings
        and so on...

    Planning to implement:
        Put more comments -> for understandability...
        Insert function -> to insert a node to the list 
                           (its like different of add_node beacause add_node pushes the new node to the end of the list)
        Sort function -> sort all the node either ascending or descending (maybe create separate funtions for these)
                        (find a way to sort any types of data) (use merge sort if possible)
        Search function -> search for a specific node with the same data from the given data
                           (maybe create a function to determine if data is sorted or not in order to find what type of search to use)
                           (use Binary Search(if possible) and Linear Search)
        Make this a into a library -> in order to be used anywhere, anytime
                                      (try to learn linkers and whatnots...)
    
    Try to find adjustments in this implementation....

    Updates:
        I've made an overload operator for the "[]" operator to give the linked list an ease of access using index..
        Also, I've added a new variable, the list_size and a getter method for this..
    Planning to implement:
        (Done!!) Put more comments -> But I think I overdid it
        (X) Insert function
        (X) Sort function
        (X) Search function
        (X) Make this a into a library

    Update:
        Just made this shit into a library!!
        But I think I need to add more functionalities or others..

    Update:
        Turns out, I have to define the class methods inside the header files when using templates, but i have fixed it already so its good!!
        I have to edit it again, the code looks ugly!!
        I've also overloaded the "[]" operator, for ease of access
    Planning to implement:
        (New!!) Remove node by data
        (New!!) Remove node by index
        (New!!) Search node by data
        (New!!) Search node by index
        (X) Insert function
        (X) Sort function

    Update:
        I have finished editing the library, now it looks fine, however, there a no comments yet..
        I've also added 2 functions: "push_front" and "remove_front"
        I removed the overloaded "[]" operator, I don't think it's useful...
    Planning to implement:
        (X) Remove node by data
        (X) Remove node by index
        (X) Search node by data
        (X) Search node by index
        (X) Insert function
        (X) Sort function
