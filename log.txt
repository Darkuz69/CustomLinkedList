    This is my take on linked list. 
    This implementation of mine uses generic typing, 
    which means, the linked list can store any type of data
    based on the type given.
    Example:
        LinkedList<int> -> LinkedList of integers
        LinkedList<char *> -> LinkedList of strings
        and so on...

    Planning to implement:
        Put more comments -> for understandability...
        Insert function -> to insert a node to the list 
                           (its like different of add_node beacause add_node pushes the new node to the end of the list)
        Sort function -> sort all the node either ascending or descending (maybe create separate funtions for these)
                        (find a way to sort any types of data) (use merge sort if possible)
        Search function -> search for a specific node with the same data from the given data
                           (maybe create a function to determine if data is sorted or not in order to find what type of search to use)
                           (use Binary Search(if possible) and Linear Search)
        Make this a into a library -> in order to be used anywhere, anytime
                                      (try to learn linkers and whatnots...)
    
    Try to find adjustments in this implementation....
